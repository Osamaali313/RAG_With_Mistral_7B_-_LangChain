Data Science involves using statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data. Machine Learning, on the other hand, is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that involves building models that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.\n","\n","Data Science problems can be broadly categorized into five types: classification, anomaly detection, clustering, regression, and reinforcement learning. Classification problems involve predicting a categorical output variable based on input features. Anomaly detection problems involve identifying unusual or rare events in a dataset. Clustering problems involve grouping similar data points together. Regression problems involve predicting a continuous output variable based on input features. Reinforcement learning problems involve learning to take actions in an uncertain and dynamic environment to maximize a reward signal.\n","\n","Machine Learning algorithms can be applied to each of these problem types to build models that can accurately predict or classify data. For example, classification algorithms such as logistic regression and support vector machines can be used for classification problems, while clustering algorithms such as k-means and hierarchical clustering can be used for clustering problems. Similarly, regression algorithms such as linear regression and neural networks can be used for regression problems, and reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning and policy gradient methods can be used for reinforcement learning problems.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["query = \"What is unsupervised Machine Learning.\"\n","response = rag_chain.invoke(query)\n","\n","print (\"Question:\", response[\"question\"])\n","print (response[\"text\"].replace('\\\\n', '\\n'))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"p6D2huPD4aX6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717800491567,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":6166,"user":{"displayName":"Syed Ali","userId":"00026085019319269903"}},"outputId":"dcebdbfe-b44d-4ada-ed7d-4a411db63813"},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Question: What is unsupervised Machine Learning.\n","\n","Instruction: Answer the question based on the following context:\n","[Document(page_content='Second National Conference on Computational Intelligence (NCCI 2018) \n","IOP Conf.

Rather it \n","simply stores the training instance and generalizing is postponed until a new instance is classifi ed. Hence \n","it is also known as lazy learner. Such methods build up a database of training instances and whenever \n","new data is presented as input it compares that data with other instances in the database using a similarity \n","measure to find the nearest match a nd make the prediction [ 4].   The lazy learner estimates the target \n","function differently and locally  for every new instance to be classified instead of estimating it globally \n","for the whole instance space hence it is faster to train but , takes time in makin g prediction [1 6]. K-\n","Means, k -medians, hierarchical clustering and expectation maximization are some popular instance -\n","based algorithms . \n","5.9. Dimensionality reduction algorithms  \n","During the past few decades, intelligent machine learning models have been adopted in numerous \n","complex  and data intensive applications like climatology, biology, astronomy, medical, economy and \n","finance. However, existing ML based systems are not sufficiently efficient and extensible enough to \n","deal with massive  and voluminous data . High dimensionality of data has proved to be a curse for data \n","processing. Another challenge is sparsity of data. Global optimum is costly to find for such data. A \n","dimensionality reduction algorithm helps in reducing the computational cost by reducing the  number of \n","dimensions  of the data . It does so by reducing the redundant and irrelevant data and cleaning the data so \n","as to improve the accuracy of results. Dimensionality reduction works in an unsupervised manner to \n","search and exploit the implicit structur e in the data [ 4, 5]. There are many algorithms for dimensionality \n","reduction that can be adapted with classification and regression algorithms like Multidimensional \n","scaling (MDS) , Principal compon ent analysis (PCA) , Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) , Principal \n","component regression (PCR) , and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) .  \n","5.10. Hybrid Learning  \n","Though ensemble learning appeared as a relief to researchers dealing with the common problems of \n","computational complexity, over fitting  and sticking to local m inima in classification algorithms, \n","researchers have found problems with ensemble learning . Complicated ensemble of multiple classifiers \n","makes it difficult to implement and difficult to analyze the results. Instead of improving accuracy of the \n","model, ensembles may tend to increase error at the level of individual base learner. Ensembles may \n","result in poor accuracy as a result of selection of poor classifiers in combination. Recent approach to \n","deal with such problems is hybridization i.e. creating ensem ble of heterogeneous models. In this, more \n","than one method is combined for example, combining clustering and decision tree or clustering and \n","association mining etc.  \n"," Out of all the above -mentioned learning paradigms, the supervised learning is by far the m ost \n","popular with researchers and practitioners.  \n","6.

Ensemble Learning  \n","It is a machine learning model  in which numerous  learners (individual models) are trained to solve a \n","common problem. Unlike  other  machine learning techniques which  learn a single hypothesis from the \n","training data, en semble learning tr ies to learn by constructing a set of hypotheses from the training data \n","and by combining them to make a prediction model [ 15,19] in order to decrease  bias(boosting),  variance  \n","(bagging) , or improve predictions(stacking). Ensemble learning can be further divided into two groups:  \n","• Sequential ensemble approaches - These are the methods in which the base learners are \n","constructed sequentially (AdaBoost). This method exploits the dependence between the base \n","learners.  \n","• Parallel ensemble approaches - In these, the base learners are independent of each other, so this \n","relationship is exploited by constructing the base learners in parallel (e.g. Random Forest)  \n","➢ Bagging:  It stands for bootstrap aggregation. It implement s homogenous learners on \n","sample populat ions and tak es the mean of all predictions [4,  15,16]. For example, M \n","different trees can be trained on dissimilar  subsets of data and compute the ensemble  \n","as: \n"," \n","➢ Boosting:  It is an iterative technique that adjusts the observation’s weight on the \n","basis of l ast classification. It tries to fit a sequence of weak learner models that \n","performs a little  better than just random predicting  e.g. small decision trees [4,1 6]. \n","AdaBoost  stand s for adaptive boosting  and is the most widely used boosting \n","algorithm.  \n","5.7. Artificial Neural Network  \n","Artificial neural network s (ANN s) are encouraged  by the biological neural network. A neural network \n","is an interconnection of neuron cells that help the electric impulses to propagate through the brain. The \n","basic unit of learning i n a neural network is a neuron, which is a nerve cell.    A neuron consists of four \n","parts, namely dendrite s (receptor), soma (processor of electric signal), nucleus ( core of the neuron) and \n","axon (the transmitt ing end of the neuron). Analogical to a biologi cal neural network, an ANN works on \n","three layers: input laye r, hidden layer and output layer. This type of network has weighted \n","interconnections and learns by adjusting the weights of interconnections in order to perform parallel \n","distributed processing. The Perceptron learning algorithm , Back -propagation algorithm , Hopfield \n","Network s, Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)  are some popular algorithms.  \n","Based on learning behavior, ANN can be further classified as:  \n","• Supervised Neural Network  – The inputs and the o utputs are presented to the network as training \n","data. The network is trained with this data by adjusting the weights  to get accurate results . When \n","it is fully trained, it is presented with unseen data to predict the output.  \n","• Unsupervised Neural Network - In unsupervised neural network, the network is not provided \n","with any output. It tries to find some structure or correlation among the input data and group \n","those data together in a group or class. When new data is presented to it as input, it identifies its \n","features and classif ies it in one of the groups based on similarities.  \n","• Reinforcement Neural Network - As human s interact with their environment and learn from \n","mistakes, a reinforcement neural network also learns from its past decision s by way of penalties \n","for wrong decisions and rewards for good decision s. The connection weights producing  correct \n","output are strengthened , while those producing incorrect responses are weakened . \n","5.8.

It was introduced by Vaswani et al. in 2017 and has since become a popular choice for NLP tasks due to its ability to handle long sequences of text and achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which process sequential data by maintaining an internal state and updating it at each time step, transformers process sequences by attending to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies more effectively. This makes them particularly useful for tasks such as machine translation, where the contextual relationship between words in a sentence can span long distances.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["query = \"What is a LSTM in Machine Learning.\"\n","response = rag_chain.invoke(query)\n","\n","print (\"Question:\", response[\"question\"])\n","print (response[\"text\"].replace('\\\\n', '\\n'))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"wOiRosgl6DDJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717800835891,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":11354,"user":{"displayName":"Syed Ali","userId":"00026085019319269903"}},"outputId":"b6d777b2-15ff-4fdf-9bff-1d3a31f76b40"},"execution_count":41,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["You seem to be using the pipelines sequentially on GPU.

These are usually used for problems that deal with questions like, ‘how much’ \n","or ‘how many’.  \n","• Clustering Problem - Clustering falls under the category of unsupervised l earning algorithms. \n","These algorithms try to learn structures within the data and attempt to make clusters based on \n","the similarity in the structure of data. The different classes or clusters are then labeled. The \n","algorithm, when trained, puts new unseen dat a in one of the clusters.  \n","• Reinforcement Problem -Reinforcement algorithms are used when a decision is to be made based \n","on past experiences of learning.  The machine  agent  learns the behaviour using trial and error \n","sort of interaction with the continuously c hanging environment. It provides a way to program \n","agents using the concept of rewards and penalties without specifying how the task is to be \n","accomplished. Game playing programs and programs for temperature control are some popular \n","examples using reinforcem ent learning.  \n"," \n","3.  Development of Machine Learning  \n","The words, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are not new. They have been  researched, \n","utilized, applied and re -invented by computer scientists, engineers, researchers, students and industry \n","professio nals for more than 60 years. The mathematical foundation of machine learning lies in algebra, \n","statistics, and probability . Serious development of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence began  \n","in 1950’s and 1960’s with the contributions  of researchers like Alan Turing, John McCarthy, Arthur \n","Samuels, Alan Newell and Frank Rosenblatt. Samuel proposed the  first working machine learning model \n","on Optimizing Checkers Program. Rosenblatt created Perceptron, a popular machine learning algorithm \n","based on biologi cal neurons which laid the foundation of Artificial Neural Network  [4, 5, 6] . The \n","following table 1 depicts the illustrious, expansive and practical development of machine learning.  \n","Table 1. Development of ML  \n","1950  Alan Turning created “Turning Test” to check a machine’s intelligence. In order to pass the \n","Turning Test, the machine should be able to convince humans that there they are actually talking to \n","a human and not a machine.  \n","1952  Samuel created a highly capable learning algorithm than can play the g ame of Checkers with itself \n","and get self -trained.  \n","1956  Martin Minsky and John McCarty with Claude Shannon and Nathan Rochester organized a \n","conference in Dartmouth in 1956 where actually Artificial Intelligence was born.  \n","1958  Frank Rosenblatt created Perc eptron, which laid the foundation stone for the development of \n","Artificial Neural Network (ANN).  \n","1967  The Nearest Neighbor Algorithm was proposed which could be used for “Pattern Recognition”.  \n","1979  Stanford University students developed “Stanford Cart”, a  sophisticated robot that could navigate \n","around a room and avoid obstacles in its path.  \n","1981  Explanation Based Learning (EBL) was proposed by Gerald Dejong, whereby, a computer can \n","analyze the training data and create rules for discarding useless data  [7] \n","1985  NetTalk was invented by Terry Sejnowski, [8] which learnt to pronounce English words in the \n","same manner that children learn.  \n","1990s  The focus of Machine Learning shifted from Knowledge -driven to Data Driven. Machine Learning \n","was implemented to analy ze large chunks of data and derive conclusions from it  [9] \n","1997:  IBM invented the Deep Blue computer which was able to beat World Chess Champion Gary \n","Kasparov.  \n","2006  The term “Deep Learning” was coined by Geoffery Hinton which referred to a new architectu re of \n","neural networks that used multiple layers of neurons for learning.  \n","2011  IBM’s Watson, built to answer questions posed in a natural language, defeats a Human Competitor \n","at Jeopardy Game.  \n","2012  Jeff Dean from Google, developed GoogleBrain, which isa D eep Neural Network to detect patterns \n","in Videos and Images.  \n","2014  Facebook invented the “DeepFace” algorithm based on Deep Neural Networks capable of', metadata={'source': '/content/ML.pdf', 'page': 4}), Document(page_content='Second National Conference on Computational Intelligence (NCCI 2018) \n","IOP Conf.

Choice of Algorithm : Not all machine learning algorithms are meant for all problems. Certain \n","algorithms are more suited to a particular class problem as explained in the previous section. \n","Selecting the best machine  learning algorithm for the problem at hand is imperative in getting the \n","best possible results. The various ML algorithms are discussed in Section 6.  \n","iv.  Selection of Models and Parameters : Most of machine learning algorithms require some initial \n","manual inter vention for setting the most appropriate values of various  parameters . \n","v. Training : After selecting the appropriate algorithm and suitable parameter values, the model needs \n","to be trained using a part of the dataset as training data.  \n","vi. Performance Evaluation : Before real -time implementation of the system, the model must be \n","tested against unseen data to evaluate how much has been learnt using various performance \n","parameters like accuracy, precision and recall.  \n"," \n","5.  Machine Learning Paradigms  \n","Depending on how an alg orithm is being trained and on the basis of availability of the output while \n","training, machine learning paradigms can be classified into ten categories. These include: supervised \n","learning, semi -supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement lear ning, evolutionary \n","learning, ensemble learning, artificial neural network, Instance -based learning, dimensionality reduction \n","algorithms and hybrid learning [4, 5, 6, 13,14,15,16 17]. Each of these paradigms is explained in the \n","following sub -sections.  \n","5.1. Supervised Learning  \n","Under supervised learning, a set of examples or training modules are provided with the correct outputs  \n","and on the basis of these training sets, the algorithm learns  to respond  more accurately by comparing its \n","output with those that are given as input . Supervised learning is also known as learning via examples or \n","learning from exemplars.  The following figure 4 explains the concept.  \n"," \n"," Fig. 4. Supervised Learning [4]  \n"," \n","Supervised learning finds applications in prediction based on historical data.

Applications of Machine Learning  \n","Machine learning problems range from game playing to self -driven vehicles.

Applications of ML  \n","Application  Description  \n","Playing \n","Checkers \n","Game  A computer program learns to play checkers game, improvises its performance as determined by its \n","ability to win at various class of tasks involving the game, through experience obtained by playing \n","games against itself.  \n","Speech \n","Recognition  The most sophisticated speech recognition systems these days deploy machine learning algorithms in \n","some  forms.

Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs have a special architecture that allows them to retain information over longer periods of time, making them particularly useful for tasks such as language modeling, speech recognition, and natural language processing. LSTMs are trained using a combination of forward and backward connections, which allow them to learn both short-term and long-term dependencies in the data. They are also designed to handle vanishing gradients, which can occur in traditional RNNs when dealing with long sequences of data. Overall, LSTMs are a powerful tool for modeling sequential data and have been shown to outperform traditional RNNs in many applications.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["query = \"What is a GRU in Machine Learning.\"\n","response = rag_chain.invoke(query)\n","\n","print (\"Question:\", response[\"question\"])\n","print (response[\"text\"].replace('\\\\n', '\\n'))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"k1j2ZBLQ6MBJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717800863477,"user_tz":-300,"elapsed":6187,"user":{"displayName":"Syed Ali","userId":"00026085019319269903"}},"outputId":"3ed2a19d-868d-4f5e-9f13-18b041fd7f16"},"execution_count":42,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Question: What is a GRU in Machine Learning.\n","\n","Instruction: Answer the question based on the following context:\n","[Document(page_content='Second National Conference on Computational Intelligence (NCCI 2018) \n","IOP Conf.

Ensemble Learning  \n","It is a machine learning model  in which numerous  learners (individual models) are trained to solve a \n","common problem. Unlike  other  machine learning techniques which  learn a single hypothesis from the \n","training data, en semble learning tr ies to learn by constructing a set of hypotheses from the training data \n","and by combining them to make a prediction model [ 15,19] in order to decrease  bias(boosting),  variance  \n","(bagging) , or improve predictions(stacking). Ensemble learning can be further divided into two groups:  \n","• Sequential ensemble approaches - These are the methods in which the base learners are \n","constructed sequentially (AdaBoost). This method exploits the dependence between the base \n","learners.  \n","• Parallel ensemble approaches - In these, the base learners are independent of each other, so this \n","relationship is exploited by constructing the base learners in parallel (e.g. Random Forest)  \n","➢ Bagging:  It stands for bootstrap aggregation. It implement s homogenous learners on \n","sample populat ions and tak es the mean of all predictions [4,  15,16]. For example, M \n","different trees can be trained on dissimilar  subsets of data and compute the ensemble  \n","as: \n"," \n","➢ Boosting:  It is an iterative technique that adjusts the observation’s weight on the \n","basis of l ast classification. It tries to fit a sequence of weak learner models that \n","performs a little  better than just random predicting  e.g. small decision trees [4,1 6]. \n","AdaBoost  stand s for adaptive boosting  and is the most widely used boosting \n","algorithm.  \n","5.7. Artificial Neural Network  \n","Artificial neural network s (ANN s) are encouraged  by the biological neural network. A neural network \n","is an interconnection of neuron cells that help the electric impulses to propagate through the brain. The \n","basic unit of learning i n a neural network is a neuron, which is a nerve cell.    A neuron consists of four \n","parts, namely dendrite s (receptor), soma (processor of electric signal), nucleus ( core of the neuron) and \n","axon (the transmitt ing end of the neuron). Analogical to a biologi cal neural network, an ANN works on \n","three layers: input laye r, hidden layer and output layer. This type of network has weighted \n","interconnections and learns by adjusting the weights of interconnections in order to perform parallel \n","distributed processing. The Perceptron learning algorithm , Back -propagation algorithm , Hopfield \n","Network s, Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)  are some popular algorithms.  \n","Based on learning behavior, ANN can be further classified as:  \n","• Supervised Neural Network  – The inputs and the o utputs are presented to the network as training \n","data. The network is trained with this data by adjusting the weights  to get accurate results . When \n","it is fully trained, it is presented with unseen data to predict the output.  \n","• Unsupervised Neural Network - In unsupervised neural network, the network is not provided \n","with any output. It tries to find some structure or correlation among the input data and group \n","those data together in a group or class. When new data is presented to it as input, it identifies its \n","features and classif ies it in one of the groups based on similarities.  \n","• Reinforcement Neural Network - As human s interact with their environment and learn from \n","mistakes, a reinforcement neural network also learns from its past decision s by way of penalties \n","for wrong decisions and rewards for good decision s. The connection weights producing  correct \n","output are strengthened , while those producing incorrect responses are weakened . \n","5.8.

There are many algorithms for dimensionality \n","reduction that can be adapted with classification and regression algorithms like Multidimensional \n","scaling (MDS) , Principal compon ent analysis (PCA) , Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) , Principal \n","component regression (PCR) , and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) .  \n","5.10. Hybrid Learning  \n","Though ensemble learning appeared as a relief to researchers dealing with the common problems of \n","computational complexity, over fitting  and sticking to local m inima in classification algorithms, \n","researchers have found problems with ensemble learning .

Machine Learning Paradigms  \n","Depending on how an alg orithm is being trained and on the basis of availability of the output while \n","training, machine learning paradigms can be classified into ten categories.

The Generic Model of ML  \n","ML is used to solve various problems that require learning on  the part of the machine.
